# FCL ROS 2

This package (`fcl_coll`) demonstrates how to perform collision detection using the [Flexible Collision Library (FCL)](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl) in a ROS 2 environment.

It loads a URDF, parses links into FCL shapes, checks for collisions (including self-collisions or with objects), and optionally visualizes collisions via RViz2 markers.
